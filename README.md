# Losing Queue

*(formerly "LoL Matchmaking Fairness" — same project, same repo, new name)*

**[losingqueue.lol](https://www.losingqueue.lol/)** — the live app.

**Was your League of Legends game actually winnable — or were you dropped into a losing queue?**

Enter a Riot ID, pick a game (or your **current live game**), and get a fairness verdict — **FAIR / NOT FAIR / FAVORED** — with a one-line reason and a lane-by-lane matchup table for all 10 players, computed from **pre-game data only** (what everyone looked like *before* the match started, not after).

> Free & open source (MIT). Fork it, self-host it in ~10 minutes on free tiers.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned next.

## Promote the project

Create a caption and share your own analyzed game from the Share sheet. See [docs/PROMOTION.md](docs/PROMOTION.md) for the cached manifest, local package generator, and publishing safeguards.

![A matchup card showing a NOT FAIR-verdict game: five lane rows with champion icons, GA scores and chips (autofill, OTP, smurf, duo, countered), a Favored column, and a team-footer win-probability bar](public/screenshot.png)
*A real analyzed game — matchmaking-side verdict (lane GA + duo synergy) split from the draft-side read (counter picks), win probability bar, and per-player chips for autofill/OTP/smurf/duo/streaks.*

## Features

- 🎯 **Ranked Solo/Duo only** (queue 420) — ARAM and flex never pollute the data
- ⏪ **Pre-game form** for every player: W-L of their 5 ranked games *before* the analyzed match — current form lies, pre-game form doesn't
- ⚖️ **Symmetric lane-by-lane matchup table**: champion · player · GA per side, `EVEN` / `BLUE +n` / `RED +n` verdicts with role icons, favored-side tinting, and a TEAM footer with the overall call
- 🎲 **Matchmaking vs. draft, split apart**: the `FAIR / NOT FAIR / FAVORED` verdict is the lobby the matchmaker handed you (lane strength, autofill, duo synergy); a separate `DRAFT` line calls out counter-picks and bot-lane synergy that are on you, not the queue
- 📊 **Win probability bar**: a poker-style blue/red % split on the same GA gap the verdict itself uses — never disagrees with the rest of the page
- 🤝 **Duo detection**: proven by *shared pre-game match IDs* (not guessed from names), with joint W-L record and a separate bot-lane (ADC+SUPPORT) synergy read from a static per-patch snapshot
- 🏷️ **At-a-glance chips** per player: `⚠️ autofill`, `OTP` / `OTP denied`, `🔗 duo`, `SMURF?`, `🔥/❄️` streaks, mastery %, rank·winrate tags, color-coded CS/min
- 👑 **MVP / ACE + 1st–10th** in-game performance ranking (KDA, kill participation, damage dealt share, **objective damage**, **damage taken** with an over-death guard, CS, vision — support- and tank-friendly)
- 🚩 **"LOSING QUEUE?" streak badge** when a player's last 3+ analyzed games were *all* stacked against them, win or lose — the matchmaker pattern, not any one result
- 🔴 **Live game analysis** (spectator-v5): analyze your *current* lobby during loading screen — know by minute 2 which lanes are favored and where to play (roles inferred from each player's history)
- 🌆 **Dynamic background**: the searched player's most-played champion splash, low-opacity behind the whole page
- 📤 **Share cards**: a "Share" button captures the *actual rendered matchup card* (not a redrawn graphic) into a downloadable/clipboard-ready PNG, plus a one-click profile link and a per-game deep link that loads keylessly for anyone
- ⭐ **Bookmarked profiles** in the search field's dropdown; with **sign-in (Clerk)** they sync across devices
- 📜 **Analyzed history** per player with pagination beyond the last 10 games
- 🔓 **Keyless browsing**: any game analyzed once is cached (Turso) and viewable by anyone with zero Riot key, forever — deep links and profile links both resolve straight from that shared cache
- 🔑 **Bring-your-own-key**: paste your free Riot API key for unlimited analyses; keyless visitors get 3 free deep analyses/day (5 when signed in) on the shared key with a fair-use lock

All data comes from the official [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com) — no scraping.

## Self-host / fork

1. **Fork this repo**, then import it on [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) — leave Root Directory empty; `vercel.json` pins the Vite build and function timeouts.
2. Create a free SQLite database at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech) and copy its URL + auth token.
3. Get a Riot API key at [developer.riotgames.com](https://developer.riotgames.com) (dev keys are free, expire every 24h; a personal key is permanent).
4. Optional accounts: create a free [Clerk](https://clerk.com) app and note its publishable key + frontend API URL.
5. In Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `RIOT_API_KEY` | shared key for keyless visitors (optional — without it the app is BYOK-only) |
   | `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` | `libsql://your-db.turso.io` |
   | `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Turso token |
   | `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | optional — Clerk publishable key (`pk_...`) |
   | `CLERK_ISSUER` | optional — e.g. `https://your-instance.clerk.accounts.dev` |

6. Deploy. Done.

### Local development

```bash
npm install
# terminal 1 — API shim on :3131 (hosts the same serverless functions locally)
RIOT_API_KEY=RGAPI-xxx TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://... TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=... CLERK_ISSUER=... npm run dev:api
# terminal 2 — Vite on :5173 (proxies /api to :3131)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_... npx vite
```

## Notes & limits

- Riot dev keys allow ~100 requests / 2 min. One uncached deep analysis ≈ 80 calls; back-to-back analyses on one key pause between games (the UI retries automatically).
- Spectator data has no assigned roles — live-game positions are inferred from each player's recent history and labeled as such.
- The GA score and verdicts are **heuristics**: a "NOT OK" lobby can still be won; the point is knowing when the queue — not you — decided the game.
- Tighten CORS / quotas before heavy public use, and mind [Riot's API policies](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies/general) beyond personal use.
- Champion-meta and bot-lane-synergy data (`lib/champstats.mjs`, `lib/duosynergy.mjs`) are static op.gg snapshots — refresh them once per patch with `node scripts/refresh-snapshots.mjs`.
